1. Recommended step: Edit manifest.json file to limit domains that extension executes on. Edit the line:
		"matches": [ "*://*/*" ],
	To for example:
		"matches": [ "*://*.hostname.com/*" ],

2. Edit the content.js file to use your DTM staging library. Edit the paramter value to a .js file on line:
		headerscript.src = "https://assets.adobedtm.com/<YOUR DTM STAGING LIBRARY>";
	For example:
		headerscript.src = "https://assets.adobedtm.com/1d9e06d7bf79e7d652hh54jj14f4157272d90778c32/satelliteLib-1d9e06d7bf79e7d652hh54jj14f4157272d90778c32-staging.js";

3. Open Chrome
4. Enter "chrome://extensions/" in the URL bar
5. Drag full DTM Drop folder onto open extensions tab.
6. Developer mode (tick box) will need to be enabled to use the extension as it has not been installed from the Chrome Store.

Copy entire folder and repeat the above for as many unique DTM libraries & domains as required.
Recommend renaming folder to "dtm-injector-<clientName>" for each instance.

This tool should be useful for:

	1.	Testing DTM rules being built before client has dropped container into their site
	2.	Testing/experimenting your own library version of rules before building them into the client staging instance.
	3.  Demos and workshops with clients where they can install and use DTM on their own live website.
